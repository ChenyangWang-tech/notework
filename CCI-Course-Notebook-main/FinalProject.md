### Project Description：

Inspired by the film Interstellar, I embarked on a creative journey to visually represent the concept of higher-dimensional space. In the movie, the five-dimensional space is portrayed as an abstract, fluid environment, with stunning visuals that convey the non-linear presentation of time in hyperspace. This portrayal, coupled with the theoretical models of four- and five-dimensional spaces, deeply influenced my design. These models suggest that just as three-dimensional objects can be projected onto a two-dimensional plane, higher-dimensional spaces can also be manipulated mathematically. Additionally, my research revealed that multi-dimensional space can be bent in accordance with the principles of general relativity, where the curvature of space-time determines the trajectory of objects.

* Inspiration and Influences
  
My approach was shaped by both artistic and scientific sources. The visual representations of black holes, wormholes, and space-time warping in Interstellar left a lasting impression on me. The film’s portrayal of the fourth dimension, particularly the character’s experience with the infinite bookshelf and the physical representation of time, provided a visual metaphor that I sought to replicate. Using simple particle systems, I aimed to evoke similar effects — abstract, yet dynamic, interpretations of higher-dimensional phenomena.

From a theoretical perspective, I drew on concepts from string theory and general relativity. In physics, higher-dimensional spaces are notoriously difficult to visualize because they exist beyond our direct perception. Therefore, I sought to use visual art as a tool to express these abstract, intangible concepts. The curvature of space-time, for instance, was an idea that guided my design, informing the way I portrayed movement and spatial distortion.

* Design Concept and Goal
  
In my design, I aimed to create a dynamic visual effect driven by particles that emerge from the edges of the canvas, follow the mouse's movement, and eventually disappear. By leveraging linear perspective, I hope to influence the viewer’s perception of depth, projecting multi-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional screen. This approach allowed me to express the curvature and movement of dimensions, with human interaction serving as a key driver of the visual changes. Through this generative art process, the final piece takes on characteristics such as fluidity, spatiality, and dynamic transformation — reflecting some of the fluid and ever-shifting qualities of high-dimensional space.

* Areas for Improvement
  
While the project has yielded a visually appealing result, I believe there are several areas for improvement. First, the movement of particles is relatively simplistic, as they simply follow the mouse position. Introducing more complex physics or interactions between particles could deepen the visual experience. For instance, particles could have varying behaviors based on velocity, acceleration, or attraction/repulsion forces.

Secondly, while the random color variations add some interest, the visual effects could benefit from greater variation. The introduction of additional factors, such as different particle sizes, transparency levels, and color gradients, could create richer, more complex visual textures. Additionally, a dynamic particle count could influence the density of the visual effect, offering an even greater range of possibilities.

Lastly, the current interaction model — where the mouse directly controls the movement of particles — feels quite straightforward. To enhance the experience, I envision incorporating more interactive elements, such as touch manipulation, drag-and-drop functionality, or even audio inputs that alter the particle system's behavior. These additions would make the experience more immersive and personal, allowing users to engage in more creative and individualized ways.

* Art and Science: A Fusion of Worlds
  
For me, the intersection of scientific theory and artistic expression is a rich and exciting realm. Scientific concepts, especially those that are abstract or beyond human perception, have always been a key source of inspiration for my work. I am deeply fascinated by the challenge of transforming these invisible theories into intuitive and engaging visual forms. This project allowed me to experiment with new ways of presenting these complex ideas, blending together technology, visual arts, and scientific exploration.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the power of different visual languages and the ways they can evoke new ways of thinking. I hope my work inspires the viewer’s imagination and curiosity, sparking further exploration into the mysteries of space, time, and dimensions.
