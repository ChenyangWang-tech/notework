**READING**

I think I am more inclined to understand the overuse, bias and neglect of technology as opposed to considering the threats posed by technology in the arts. Technological innovation in the arts makes sense in its own right, as the developers of design break with the original and only way of doing things - reframing presents new challenges and opportunities and offers new options for problem solving that may re-purpose creative opportunities. But further commercialisation, which requires making technology more basic and relevant to people's lives. Certainly, digital living in itself is right, but the commercial companies that have created an environment where we are flattered, pushed and misled to provide data are wrong.
I think it is important for people to face up to the people in tech companies and industries and explore how superficially those development teams perceive technology and design. The narrower the vision of these people, the more they design and code for some personal gain and take no responsibility for the outcome, which is why it is easier to breed a social environment that is unequal, sensitive and vindictive. Culture and technology design and art all influence each other. At the same time, the big tech companies are developing more ‘convenient’ technologies that get a moral free pass through false promises of technology wrapped in carefully designed packages. We should put pressure on them and keep it up until things change. We have a responsibility to embrace new digital tools, to show optional, public sources and destinations of data, and to enable people to make the choices they need to make, if technology is to be used in a truly virtuous way.

**REFLECTING**

Firstly, I thought about how to produce small circles of random size, random position and random thickness in a large circle. I used the for（） function to loop through the number of circles less than 30. I learnt how to use the cos and sin formulas to calculate the position of a random circle that can appear inside a large circle and set the random（） function so that the small circle does not exceed the random radius of the large circle. But I found that the dynamic image can only appear all the circles at the same time, can not appear different thickness of the line and can not pause. I then added a startButton and stopButton to control the image transformation, and used the if（） function to control the thickness of the line around the edge of the circle. Finally, set the empty array of smallCircles = [] and push() to store the information of the small circles, let the variable currentCircleIndex and setInterval() to appear and store the small circles at regular intervals, so that the small circles can appear sequentially.In the next iteration, I will try to make the edge line thickness of the small circle gradually thicker and make the centre of the circle as close to the centre of the compound as possible.

This project has given me a deep impression of the complexity of the code and the boredom and lack of patience to make changes during the process. However, the new effects that appeared after the modification would make me feel novel again. At the same time, I believe that the learning of code must be the ability to screen for errors and solve them, in the process of subtle self-learning and progress, so as to achieve personal satisfaction.
