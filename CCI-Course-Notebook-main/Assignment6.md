THE CRITICAL CODING MANIFESTO
0. The Critical coder considers coding to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the Critical coder to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.
1. The Critical coder considers any technology depended upon to be both a challenge and a threat. The greater the dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings, regardless of ownership or legal provision.
2. The Critical coder raises awareness that with each technological advance our techno-political literacy is challenged. 
3. The Critical coder deconstructs and incites suspicion of rich user experiences.
4. The Critical coder looks beyond the 'awe of implementation' to determine methods of influence and their specific effects. 
5. The Critical coder recognises that each work of coding coders its user, proportional to that user's dependency upon it. 
6. The Critical coder expands 'machine' to describe interrelationships encompassing devices, bodies, agents, forces and networks. 
7. The Critical coder observes the space between the production and consumption of technology. Acting rapidly to changes in this space, the Critical coder serves to expose moments of imbalance and deception.
8. The Critical coder looks to the history of art, architecture, activism, philosophy and invention and finds exemplary works of Critical coding. Strategies, ideas and agendas from these disciplines will be adopted, re-purposed and deployed. 
9. The Critical coder notes that written code expands into social and psychological realms, regulating behaviour between people and the machines they interact with. By understanding this, the Critical coder seeks to reconstruct user-constraints and social action through means of digital excavation.
10. The Critical coder considers the exploit to be the most desirable form of exposure.

Social Turkers: crowdsourced dating
Artist name：lauren mccarthy
Year: 2013

Description: 
What if we could receive real-time feedback on our social interactions? Would unbiased third party monitors be better suited to interpret situations and make decisions for the parties involved? How might this help us become more aware in our relationships, and more open to unexpected possibilities?

I am developing a system like this for myself using Amazon Mechanical Turk. During a series of dates with new people I meet through the internet, I will discretely stream the interaction to the web using an iPhone app. Turk workers will be paid to watch the stream, interpret what is happening, and offer feedback as to what I should do or say next. This feedback will be communicated to me via text message.

Through this series of interaction experiments, I will refine the rules of the system — the type of feedback and rating the turkers provide, and the amount and frequency of their influence. I will also keep public logs of the responses of the turkers and my own reflections on what transpires during each interaction.

Reflecting:
This approach has also led me to think about issues of privacy, data protection and ethics. For example, how are user data and personal privacy collected, stored and used? How can crowdsourcing participants ensure fair and unbiased matching and advice? Is there potential for abuse or inappropriate behaviour in such social interactions?

Firstly, allowing external participants, who may not fully understand the user's background, to rate and advise others on their dating profiles and interactions is worth pondering. Such interventions have the potential to trigger power inequalities, bias. Secondly, the standardisation of socialisation that may result from using collective mass selection to control one's relationships can lead to a gradual loss of individuality.
