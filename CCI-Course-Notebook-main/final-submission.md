### Project Description：

Inspired by the film Interstellar, I used the multidimensional space of the universe as my inspiration to begin my search for a visual representation of higher dimensional space. In the film, the five-dimensional space is the product of the abstraction of the scenes, and this design was inspired by the mathematical models of four (and five) dimensional space, especially for the non-linear presentation of time in hyperspace. I then conducted some research and finally filtered out two theoretical bases to support my design. Firstly, based on my research I learnt that four and five dimensional spaces are also manipulable in mathematics, just as three dimensional objects can be projected onto a two dimensional plane. Secondly, I learnt that multi-dimensional space is bendable in general relativity, and that the curved space-time determines the trajectory of motion.

* Inspiration and Influences
  
While working on this project, I referenced a lot of information about particle systems, space-time warping, and multi-dimensional space visualisation, and was inspired by two aspects. Firstly, the visual representation of black holes, wormholes and space-time bending in the science fiction film Interstellar captivated me. The film left me with impressive representations of high-dimensional space through stunning visual effects (e.g. the main character sees an infinite bookshelf and the physical representation of ‘time’ when entering the fourth dimension). These abstract concepts inspired me to try to emulate similar effects through simple particle systems. Secondly, in terms of maths and physics theory, I drew on abstract concepts from string theory and relativity, particularly ideas about the curvature of space-time, to inspire how to visually represent the distortion of space-time. In physics, four-dimensional space and higher dimensions are inherently difficult to visualise, so I express them artistically through visuals.


* Design Concept and Goal
  
In the design, my goal is to create a dynamic visual effect based on particles that start from the edge of the canvas, follow the mouse movement to generate a visual path, and eventually disappear. Through this linear perspective, we hope to influence the viewer's perception of depth, trying to ‘project’ multi-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional screen. We try to ‘project’ the multi-dimensional space onto the two-dimensional image, and express the curvature and movement of the dimensions according to the human interaction. This generative art finally produces a special image that demonstrates some similar fluidity, spatiality and dynamic changes.

* Areas for Improvement
  
While the project has yielded a visually appealing result, I believe there are several areas for improvement. First, the movement of particles is relatively simplistic, as they simply follow the mouse position. Introducing more complex physics or interactions between particles could deepen the visual experience. For instance, particles could have varying behaviors based on velocity, acceleration, or attraction/repulsion forces.

Secondly, while the random color variations add some interest, the visual effects could benefit from greater variation. The introduction of additional factors, such as different particle sizes, transparency levels, and color gradients, could create richer, more complex visual textures. Additionally, a dynamic particle count could influence the density of the visual effect, offering an even greater range of possibilities.

Lastly, the current interaction model — where the mouse directly controls the movement of particles — feels quite straightforward. To enhance the experience, I envision incorporating more interactive elements, such as touch manipulation, drag-and-drop functionality, or even audio inputs that alter the particle system's behavior. These additions would make the experience more immersive and personal, allowing users to engage in more creative and individualized ways.

* Art and Science: A Fusion of Worlds
  
Scientific theories have always been a source of inspiration for my artistic creations, and I have been thinking about how to express abstract scientific concepts, especially those phenomena beyond human perception, through technology and visual arts. I have a strong interest in trying to combine the two seemingly unrelated fields, so this time I am trying to work with science fiction literature and astronomy. The question of how to transform abstract or invisible scientific theories that are difficult to present into intuitive artistic or visual expressions has carried me throughout my creative process, and it has also prompted me to keep reflecting on it, and to keep learning to improve the new ways of presenting it. Through this project, I have learnt more about the different effects produced by different visual languages, which I hope will inspire people's infinite imagination.
