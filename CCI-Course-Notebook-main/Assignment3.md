**READING**

I couldn't agree more with the end of the article that we need to be active opponents of the harms of computers, and that we should have the ability to properly scrutinise, imagine, and reason about new computing systems for this purpose. But this leads me to another question, how can we tell if we are moving in the direction of effective improvement, and whether the constant improvement of new computing systems will reach the ultimate equality, fairness, and justice, or how far will the improvement reach the end?

First of all, these questions remind me of an anime called PSYCHO-PASS, which sets out to establish a Sibyl System - a powerful psychic index monitoring network - in future Japanese society to scan and actively monitor the mental and spiritual state of the citizens by sound and video, and the system also predicts the likelihood of a person committing a crime and numerically quantifies it into a ‘crime index’, which can be used by the criminal police to determine the likelihood of a person committing a crime. The system also predicts the likelihood of a person committing a crime and quantifies it as a ‘crime index’, which can be used by the criminal police to maintain public order. This has also aroused my doubt as to whether there will be real freedom in a society under the control of machines if this technology can really be realised.

Secondly, as I was thinking about the issue of fairness in computing systems, I realised that there still exists a case related to inequality in machine learning, in the form of machine bias. In the study, the subjects were investigated by ProPublica's methodology used in the United States to test and assess the risk of future reoffending. The machine bias was shown to be that blacks would generally be assessed as having a higher maximum risk of reoffending than whites, and that black defendants were three times more likely to be incorrectly rated as high risk than white defendants. I think it is difficult to assess true fairness, equality, and justice under the current computer system alone, and that it is necessary to rely on an integrated, holistic approach.

Regarding the improvement of computing systems, I know that social systems are large, disordered, and irregular, while technology is unique and controllable, so fair and equal computing systems need to be designed and built by machine learning systems. Because the system is only made up of inputs and outputs, i.e. it is a property of technological tools, whereas fairness is a property of social and legal systems. So in order to achieve fairness, it is necessary to transform fairness and justice as a technical term independent of the social context into a technical category error. In Fairness and Abstraction in Society, the authors identify five abstraction errors and their corresponding solutions, namely, the ‘framing trap,’ the ‘portability trap,’ the ‘formalism trap,’ the ‘ripple trap,’ and the ‘formalism trap. ‘ ‘The Ripple Effect Trap’ and ‘The Solution Trap’. They emphasised the shift in technical work from a focus on solutions to a focus on process, the construction of different frameworks and, more importantly, the development of socio-technical thinking. Only in this way can relevant technology practitioners participate more meaningfully and efficiently in the improvement of the social environment.

**REFLECTING**

In regards to displaying a continuum of order and chaos, I immediately associated it with the weaving of a spider's web. When it comes to spider webs, it is often the case that orb webs consist of radial circles that protrude into a spiral in the centre to trap food. The orderliness of a radial spider web conforms to biodynamics, distributing forces on the web evenly. In reality, however, no web in the world is the same. This is not only because each spider has its own web-weaving characteristics, but also modifies the design of its web according to the wind and its surroundings - it's all about variation and chance.

Hybrid Webs’ by Argentinian artist Tomás Saraceno, an art installation also inspired by spiders, explores the connection between trans-science and ecosystems. In my understanding, this connection is articulated in the metaphorical way of a spider's web. He abstracts and extends the concept of the spider's web as a physical extension of its feelings and perceptions, as well as a physical manifestation of its connection to its surroundings. The installation crosses the boundaries of species in search of a more equal equilibrium between any element on earth. This equilibrium is the stable order, the unbreakable boundaries between the elements from ancient times to the present. Once there is a change in one organism, a thousand other organisms will change as well.
