**READING**

I agree with the article that critical thinking can lead designers to delve into the cultural, historical and social context of a project to create more meaningful designs.

I don't think the level of what form of critical thinking is completely consistent in any individual; everyone is subject to undisciplined or irrational thought. Its quality, therefore, is usually a matter of degree, depending, among other things, on the quality and depth of experience with particular categories of issues. No one is an outright critical thinker. The development of critical thinking skills is therefore a lifelong endeavour.

Thus, if properly conceived, critical thinking is a self-directed, self-regulating mind that attempts to reason impartially at the highest level of quality. We should avoid simply thinking about complex issues, endeavour to give due consideration to the rights and needs of relevant others, and be aware of the difficulties of developing as a mind and commit to a lifelong practice of self-improvement.

**REFLECTING**

Creates a canvas and sets it to draw only once. Set the line thickness and colour to fill the background on the canvas and use nested loops to draw multiple shapes, each spaced apart. Change the position of the walker by updating the x or y value based on a randomly generated num value. Finally add lines with dark to light colours in each segment.
